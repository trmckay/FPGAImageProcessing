# RISCV Image Processing
Sobel edge detection and general purpose kernel convolution in C. Written for a RISC-V microprocessor. Use the RISC-V GNU toolchain to build this project for your microprocessor. You will likely need to adjust the method used to represent and draw images to agree with however a specific processor accomplishes this.

Here is a video demoing the project on the OTTER, a RISC-V microprocessor implemented using a Basys3 FPGA.
